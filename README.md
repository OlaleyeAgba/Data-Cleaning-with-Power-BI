### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Data Cleaning tasks include:
- Data loading and inspection:

  Cookie- 1.0, Tea- 1.5,  Coffee - 2.0, Cake and Juice - 3.0, Smoothie and Sandwich-4.0 and Salad-5.0.

  For each new table for Cookie, Tea, Coffee and Salad the Error, Empty and Unknown values of the price per unit was replaced by their respective price per unit. 

  For Cake and Juice having the same price per unit, Error value for Cake while Empty and Unknown for Juice. 

  For Smoothie and Sandwich having the same price per unit, Empty and Unknown for Smoothies while Error for Sandwich. 

  For Null Price per unit: Replace the null price by using conditional formatting to get the price the price from the Replace Error, Empty and Unknown with 1.0 which is equivalent to Cookie.
